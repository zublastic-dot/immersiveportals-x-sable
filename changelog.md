## [Unreleased Changes]

### Zublastic client clipping candidate

- Keep IP/Sable clip distances disabled for copy shaders that do not write them;
  restore the correct planes for geometry and both Sable cuts.
- Make explicit clipping resets reach GL and invalidate uniform locations on
  Mojang program deletion/relink. Visual acceptance remains pending; see
  `docs/ZUBLASTIC_PORTAL_RENDERING.md`.

Atlas hardening since the 0.5.0 merge (PR #15):

### Fixed

- Multi-portal straddle: contact clipping is aperture-bounded again — the 0.5.0
  full-plane clip let two sessions' half-spaces swallow a ship, and parts beside a
  free-standing frame lost ground collision.
- Ships whose parent dimension is unloaded (e.g. a nether ship while everyone is in
  the overworld) fell through the world. They now go dormant (native Fixed body,
  zero tick cost) and wake in place when a player loads the area; no chunks are
  force-loaded.
- Ships in different parent dimensions collided when their coordinates overlapped
  (per-body parent-frame check in the native dispatcher).
- Connected ships got stuck on the wrong logical side of a portal: the per-member
  transit gate deadlocked once the first member crossed (gate removed).
- A roped partner no longer teleports through together with the crossing ship.
- Modded packet handlers resolve hosted-ship positions correctly: deferred
  world-frames wrap payload dispatch, arming on first hosted-plot resolution
  (fixes Simulated assembly interactions and Photomancy blueprint capture).
- Disassembly desync: block-restore notifications on a hosted ship routed to the
  hosting level (no chunk holder) and vanished; the client never saw the ship
  turn back into blocks.
- Teleports targeting the hosting dimension (e.g. Waystones placed on ships)
  redirect to the ship's parent dimension; Waystones' own distance check resolves
  ship-frame waystone positions through the delegate dimension.
- Entities parked at plot coordinates in a parent level (Simulated's ship-attached
  plungers) were garbage-collected by vanilla's entity-chunk unload within
  seconds, orphaning their physics joints. Three layers: plot-ticking memberships
  ignore the id-aliased client copy (vanilla Entity.equals compares by id, so
  singleplayer client lerps corrupted server state), plot-parked entities are
  exempt from chunk store/unload (player semantics), and entity-chunk visibility
  downgrades on live plot chunks re-assert ENTITY_TICKING.
- Client copies of plot-parked entities never ticked (no real parent client chunk
  at plot coordinates), freezing attach animations and orientation — the plunger's
  rope spline rendered permanently mid-connect. The client now mirrors the server's
  plot-chunk entity-ticking bridge.
- Plunger rope visuals: paired plungers no longer draw their rope to the world
  origin when the partner's client entity is transiently missing (Simulated zeroes
  its synced target client-side every tick; the synced value is restored), and
  client-side kicks through a not-yet-synced sub-level pose are skipped instead of
  teleporting the entity to ~(0,0,0).

### Changed

- Rigid assemblies (swivel bearings, fixed couplings — joints locking an angular
  axis) cross portals atomically as one unit.
- Ropes span portals: a crossed ship's rope routes through the aperture and pulls
  the trailing body toward it; the chain follows once both ends cross, and backing
  out unwinds. Ropes overstretched past 1.75× natural length (snagged trailing
  body, cross-dimension splits) break, vanilla-lead-style.

### Known Issues

- Rare missed rope re-unification when both ends cross the same portal within a
  tick (diagnostics in place).
