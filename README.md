# Zublastic maintenance fork

Based on [GaMiR9195's 0.5.0 fork](https://github.com/GaMiR9195/immersiveportals-x-sable).
Version `0.5.1-zublastic.1` repairs chunk-loading throttling and ticket cleanup;
it preserves the upstream Sable/portal integration. It does not claim to fix all
rendering or compatibility issues. See [evidence and build notes](docs/ZUBLASTIC_CHUNK_TICKETS.md).

Operators can run `imm_ptl_chunk_tickets` to inspect admitted, completed,
pending and failed requests per dimension. A persistent request gets a bounded
warning after 60 seconds; real failed futures still report their cause.

## Upstream v0.5.0 notes
1) Better Sodium compatibility (same dimension + recursion stuff).
2) Fixed clipping-through-walls: it used to stop at portal size. Now it doesn’t. Ever.
3) HUGE amount of rendering bug fixes.
5) Portal something sub-level mesh bug with empty triangles was fixed; Small sub-level part behind a portal was removed. 
6) Full rewrite of how we store sub-levels in another dimension.
7) Portals on sub-levels.
8) A small 0.01 z-fighting offset was compensated (0.01 pixel visual gap).
9) Breaking sub-level into 2 pieces works again.
10) Multi-part global blocks (e.g., swivel bearings, wheels, springs) are working again (WIP).
11) One-block sub-levels are visible again.
12) New “Physics Staff” mixin, works with recursion (still kinda WIP).
13) New, portals now have colliders.
14) New, connected sub-levels (with blocks like bearing, springs, ropes) work through portals. 

# Immersive Portals × Sable Compatibility Fork
Version: NeoForge 1.21.1; Targets: Sable 2.0.3+ · Create Aeronautics 1.3.0+ · Create 6.0.10

This is a fork of Immersive Portals for people that want Sable + physics-sublevels + (maybe) Aeronautics
and got tired of portals working like shit.

Goal: ships (and other physics-assembled sub-levels) can:
- render correctly when they’re halfway through a portal (clipped at the frame, both sides)
- keep working physics on both sides while straddling
- move through dimensions as one continuous motion (not a hard teleport)
- have portals on sub-levels, bound to them like a monolith
- portals can traverse through protals

Not a general IP release. It’s experimental, and built for this stack, with love.

Upstream IP (NeoForge): https://github.com/iPortalTeam/ImmersivePortalsModForNeo
Sable: https://github.com/ryanhcode/sable

# What’s the trick?
Sable normally “hides” each sub-level by shoving its blocks far away inside a dimension.
IP is like “cool, I’m rendering/simulating multiple dimensions anyway.”

So this fork basically says:
- sub-level blocks live ONCE in a dedicated hosting dimension: `ipl_sable:sublevels`
- “parent dimension” is just metadata (where the ship *belongs* / which physics scene owns it)

Then we glue the rest together:
- Rendering: straddling ships draw in both dimensions, clipped cleanly at the portal plane.
- Physics: each dimension gets its own Rapier scene. A straddling ship gets a clone body on the other side,
  pinned every substep, and the solver’s corrections get copied back.
  Also: contacts get clipped at the portal aperture (requires patched natives; see below).
- Transit: crossing the plane flips the ship’s parent + remaps pose through the portal. No block copying.
- Interaction: targeting/outlines/break/place/redstone/BE logic and cross-portal manipulation work on ship blocks.
  Also the physics staff can grab/drag through the mess.

# What works
- Hosted sub-levels save/load correctly in any dimension.
- Portal straddle rendering (including portals-in-portals).
- Straddle physics: the “through” part collides with the destination world like it actually exists there.
  Standing/walking/riding on the through-part behaves like it should (including friction).
- Block interaction on through-part: break/place + outlines + prediction + redstone + pistons + block entities.
- Create stuff on ships (drills/deployers/etc) can interact with the parent world (world-frame routing).
- Physics staff: lock/drag works on the through-part from either side.
- Dimension stack seams: IP vertical stacking portals behave (scaled/inverted stacks: transit works).

# Known limitations
- Performance (Sub Level stuttering)
- DH + Voxy Support
- Bugs

# Build
NeoForge 1.21.1, JDK 21: `./gradlew jarJar` → jar in `build/libs/`

Patched physics natives live under `natives/` (Sable Rust workspace fork + aperture clipping extension + atlas approach).
Windows x86_64 build script: `natives/build-windows.ps1`
If you don’t build natives, mod still runs — you just lose aperture contact clipping.

# About Immersive Portals (upstream)
Immersive Portals does see-through portals, portals-in-portals, seamless teleportation, and non-euclidean weirdness.
If you like this fork, please consider starring the upstream project too — they did the heavy lifting.
