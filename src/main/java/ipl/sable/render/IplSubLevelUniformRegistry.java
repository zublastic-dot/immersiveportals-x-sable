/**
 * Registry of every GL program known to carry the
 * {@code ipl_subLevelClipEquation} uniform, with the resolved uniform
 * location for each.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this exists:</b> The original slot-1 propagation path
 * (write at {@code SubLevelClipUniformPatcher.patchForSubLevel} +
 * piggyback {@code _glUseProgram} HEAD writes for subsequent shader
 * binds) doesn't cover programs that were bound BEFORE a sub-level
 * bracket started. In GL, {@code glUseProgram} only fires when the
 * binding actually changes; programs that stay bound across many draws
 * (like batched terrain or block-entity programs that Iris reuses)
 * never re-trigger the upload, so their slot-1 uniform stays at its
 * initial {@code (0,0,0,1)} default → {@code dot(pos, 0) + 1 > 0}
 * always passes → cog meshes leak through portals.
 *
 * <p>Diagnosed via RenderDoc EID comparison: at EID 2260 (airship,
 * working) program 5058 had {@code slot-1 = (1.0, 0.0, 0.0, -2.022906)}
 * matching the patcher's logged write; at EID 2579 (cog, leaking)
 * program 5073 — a different Iris-rewritten {@code moving_block}-style
 * program — had {@code slot-1 = (0,0,0,1)} because the patcher's
 * upload only touched whatever shader was bound at the moment it ran.
 *
 * <p><b>How it's wired:</b> {@code IplGlUseProgramProbeMixin}
 * populates this registry on first {@code _glUseProgram} per program
 * (the same caching path it already does for {@code IPL$LOC_CACHE}).
 * {@code SubLevelClipUniformPatcher.patchForSubLevel} iterates the
 * registry and writes the new equation to every entry via
 * {@code glProgramUniform4f}, which targets a program regardless of
 * whether it's the currently-bound program. {@code clearAndUpload}
 * resets all entries to the no-clip identity.
 *
 * <p>Thread-safety: all writes happen on the render thread, but using
 * a {@link ConcurrentMap} keeps the contract explicit and the iteration
 * weakly-consistent without throwing {@code ConcurrentModificationException}
 * if a new program registers mid-iteration.
